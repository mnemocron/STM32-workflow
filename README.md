# STM32-workflow
Workflow guidelines, tipps, good practices and instructions when developing embedded firmware for STM32

## Purpose

The software development of new embedded systems reaches ever greater levels of complexity. 
The familiarization with the project's hard- and software components happens during the development itself. 
In case a project has not been worked on for a long time, but new changes are required, a lot of time is needed to get familiar with the project again. 
The same problem exists when new employees work on a project.
Good documentation is essential for time efficient onboarding and avoiding bugs.
This document serves as a guideline for good documentation of software projects.

Furthermore, some methods and steps in the development process can be introduced to further improve quality of the end product.
This document gives insight into some of those techniques and how to apply them.
